About Our App:

For people wanting to improve their mental health, it can often be helpful for them to write down how they are feeling and why. FeelApp is an app that aims to make it easier for people to do this by helping them keep track of their mood. 

Our app allows users to easily create a record of their mood by tapping on different mood icons and providing a short explanation and/or photo to document why they are feeling that way. Users can then view a timeline of their mood history or see charts that shows how frequently they experience certain moods. As such, FeelApp acts as an easy to manage personal diary that allows people to understand how they have felt and why, paving the way for them to make improvements to their mental health. For users who feel overwhelmed and want to seek help, FeelApp also contains helpful links so they can get access to professional counselling services. In addition to mood tracking, there is a social component to FeelApp that lets users anonymously share how they are feeling and why. Other users can then view those posts and offer words of encouragement or give helpful advice. 

Overall, the goal of FeelApp is to empower users to take charge of improving their mental health through easy to use mood tracking, and the ability to share stories and receive words of encouragement.
